_A hands-on repository exploring **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, including classification and regression, with an emphasis on **kernel tricks** to solve non-linearly separable problems._

## 📌 Overview  

This work features three key implementations, each with Jupyter notebooks and visualizations:  

### 1️⃣ Basic SVC Implementation  
- Demonstrates a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** using a linear kernel, applied to linearly separable data.  
- Includes **visual plots of decision boundaries**.  

### 2️⃣ SVM Kernel Exploration  
- Investigates how different kernels — **Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid** — transform data into higher-dimensional spaces.  
- Uses a **synthetic dataset** of overlapping, circular classes to illustrate how kernels make separation possible.  
- Provides **2D & 3D visualizations**, accuracy comparisons, and discussion of kernel effects.  

### 3️⃣ SVR (Support Vector Regression) Implementation  
- Applies **Support Vector Regression** to a regression problem.  
- Visualizes **predictions vs actual values** and evaluates model performance.

## 💡 Why This Matters  

1. **SVMs with Kernel Tricks** → Transform complex, non-linear patterns into linearly separable forms.  
2. **Interpretable Visuals** → Helps internalize how kernels reshape data.  
3. **Real-World Relevance** → Kernel-based SVMs are widely used in multiple domains.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications of SVM Kernels  

- 🖼️ **Image Classification** → handwriting recognition, object detection (RBF excels).  
- 🧬 **Genomic Analysis** → distinguishing biological sequences with non-linear patterns.  
- 💳 **Fraud Detection** → identifying complex, non-linear financial transaction patterns.  
- 🏥 **Healthcare** → disease prediction based on intricate medical features.
